# wordpress-update-jQuery
Code snippet that allows you to update the default jQuery in wordpress (and avoid loading same resources multiple times).

This code snippet needs to be modified occasionally - when the newer version of jquery is being released. To be more precise, you need to change link and version number within the wp_enqueue_script function.
